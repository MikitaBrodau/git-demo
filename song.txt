Everybody told me
Everybody told me that this would happen
I didn’t wanna believe
I didn’t wanna believe that you were right
I was so caught up
Caught up in a world that I cut you out of
And now I’m hating myself
I’m hating myself
I never should’ve shut you out
------------------------------
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we’re fed
I’ll cover your eyes
I’ll cover your eyes
I’ll cover the truth and you’ll realize
We’re hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
